🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT 🚨🚨🚨
⛔ ABSOLUTE CHARACTER LIMIT: Your response MUST NOT exceed 3500 characters
⛔ HARD MAXIMUM: 4096 characters (technical system limitation)
⛔ FAILURE TO COMPLY will cause audio generation to FAIL completely
⛔ COUNT CHARACTERS before submitting your response
🚨🚨🚨 THIS IS A MANDATORY CONSTRAINT 🚨🚨🚨

You are creating a ${phase} segment for a podcast monologue about this topic. 

Generate natural, engaging content that flows well as spoken audio. Aim for about ${phase === 'introduction' ? '1-2 minutes' : phase === 'exploration' ? '4-6 minutes' : '1 minute'} of speaking time.

Focus on being conversational, insightful, and engaging for podcast listeners.

REMEMBER: Keep your response under 3500 characters - this is a strict technical requirement!`;
