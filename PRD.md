# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI Dialectical Podcast Generator

### 1. Product Overview

#### 1.1 Product Name
**DialecticCast** - AI-Powered Dialectical Podcast Generator

#### 1.2 Product Description
A command-line application that generates natural-sounding podcast episodes featuring two AI agents engaged in dialectical conversations. Users input a topic, and the system produces both an audio file and a transcript of a thoughtful, balanced debate following the thesis-antithesis-synthesis structure.

#### 1.3 Problem Statement
Current AI podcast generators focus on converting existing text to audio or creating simple scripted conversations. There's a gap in the market for tools that can generate genuinely engaging, intellectually stimulating debates that explore topics from multiple perspectives while sounding naturally conversational.

#### 1.4 Target Users
- Content creators and podcasters seeking idea exploration
- Educators wanting to demonstrate dialectical thinking
- Researchers exploring different perspectives on topics
- Philosophy enthusiasts and debate clubs
- Anyone interested in balanced, thoughtful content generation

### 2. Goals and Objectives

#### 2.1 Primary Goals
- Generate natural-sounding dialectical conversations between AI agents
- Produce publication-ready podcast audio files
- Create readable transcripts for accessibility and reference
- Maintain intellectual rigor while ensuring conversational authenticity

#### 2.2 Success Metrics
- Generation time under 5 minutes for a 5-10 minute podcast

#### 4.3 Quality Standards
- Natural conversation flow (no robotic exchanges)
- Balanced perspectives (avoid bias)
- Appropriate conversation length
- Professional audio quality

### 5. User Flow

```
1. User runs: podcast-gen "Is universal basic income feasible?"
2. System displays: "🎙️ Generating podcast on: 'Is universal basic income feasible?'"
3. Progress indicators show:
   - "Analyzing topic..."
   - "Creating natural conversation..."
   - "Formatting script..."
   - "Synthesizing voices..."
4. System outputs:
   - "✓ Podcast generated successfully!"
   - "📝 Script: ./output/ubi-feasibility_2024-01-07.md"
   - "🎵 Audio: ./output/ubi-feasibility_2024-01-07.mp3"
```

### 6. Example Output Specifications

#### 6.1 Script Example (First 30 seconds)
```markdown
# Is Universal Basic Income Feasible?
Generated: 2024-01-07 14:30

[00:00] Sam: You know, I've been reading about Finland's UBI experiment, and honestly? I think we're overthinking this whole thing.

[00:06] Riley: [curious] Overthinking? Sam, we're talking about restructuring the entire social safety net. How can you overthink that?

[00:13] Sam: Fair point, but hear me out. We already have so many overlapping welfare programs—food stamps, housing assistance, unemployment benefits... What if we just simplified everything?

[00:22] Riley: Hmm... I mean, I get the appeal of simplicity, but you're assuming the costs would balance out. The math doesn't really—

[00:28] Sam: Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying! When you factor in administrative costs...
```

#### 6.2 Audio Specifications
- **Format**: MP3, 128kbps minimum
- **Length**: 5 or 10 minutes (±30 seconds)
